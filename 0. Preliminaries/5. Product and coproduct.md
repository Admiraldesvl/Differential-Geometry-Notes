## Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category and $A,B \in \operatorname{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$. By a **product** of $B,C$ we mean a triple $(P,f,g)$ with $P \in \operatorname{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ and $f,g$ as follows satisfying the following condition:

Given two morphisms
$$
\varphi: A \to B \quad \text{and} \quad \psi: A \to C
$$
in $\mathcal{C}$, there exists a unique morphism $h: A \to P$ which makes the following diagram commutative:

Or equivalently, we have $\varphi=f \circ h$ and $\psi = g \circ h$.

For more than two objects, namely we have a family of objects $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}\subset\operatorname{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$, a product for this family consists of $(P,\{f_i\}_{i\in{I}})$ where $P \in \operatorname{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ and $\{f_i\}_{i\in{I}}$ is a family of morphisms
$$
f_i:P \to A_i
$$
such that, for the given family of morphisms
$$
g_i:C \to A_i
$$
there exists a unique morphism $h: C \to P$ such that $g_i \circ h = f_i \circ h$. The morphism $h$ is said to be induced by the family $\{g_i\}_{i \in I}$.
