## Topological Space

### Definition

A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is a set $X$ with a collection $\tau$ of subsets such that

1. $X \in \tau$, $\varnothing \in \tau$.
2. $ \bigcup_{\alpha}A_\alpha \in \tau$ for some $\alpha \in A$ and $A_\alpha \in \tau$. That is, $\tau$ is closed under *arbitrary* union.
3. $\bigcap_{k=1}^{n}A_n \in \tau$ for $A_n \in \tau$. That is, $\tau$ is closed under arbitrary union and finite intersections.

The members of $\tau$ are called *open sets*. The complement of open sets (with respect to $X$) are called closed sets. A set is closed if and only if the complement is open.

### Hausdorff space

A topological space $X$ is called Hausdorff if, for any $x,y\in X$ where $x \neq y$, there exists some $U_x$ and $U_y$ such that $x \in U_x$, $y \in U_y$, $U_x \cap U_y = \varnothing$.
