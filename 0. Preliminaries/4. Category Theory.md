## Definition

A category $\mathscr{C}$ consists of a collection of objects $\operatorname{Ob}(\mathscr{C})$. For two objects $A,B \in \operatorname{Ob}(\mathscr{C})$, a set $\operatorname{Mor}(A,B)$ is called the set of morphisms of $A$ into $B$. Pick $A,B,C \in \operatorname{Ob}(\mathscr{C})$, a law of composition or a map
$$
\operatorname{Mor}(A,B)\times\operatorname{Mor}(B,C) \to \operatorname{Mor}(A,C)
$$
satisfies the following axioms.

> 1. **(Disjointness)** Two sets $\operatorname{Mor}(A,B)$ and $\operatorname{Mor}(A',B')$ are always disjoint, unless $A=A'$ and $B=B'$, in which case they are equal.
> 2. **(Identity)** For each object $A \in \operatorname{Ob}(\mathscr{C})$ , there is a morphism $\operatorname{id_A}\in\operatorname{Mor}(A,A)$ which acts as left and right identity for the elements of $\operatorname{Mor}(A,B)$ and $\operatorname{Mor}(B,A) $ respectively, for all $B \in \operatorname{Ob}(\mathscr{C})$.
> 3. **(Associativity)** The law of composition is associative when defined.

To explain the identity, for any $f_{AB} \in \operatorname{Mor}(A,B)$,  we have
$$
(\operatorname{id_A},f_{AB}) \mapsto f_{AB}
$$
In fact we can write it as
$$
f_{AB} \circ\operatorname{id_A}=f_{AB}
$$
since we write the composition of an element $g \in \operatorname{Mor}(B,C)$ and an element of $f \in \operatorname{Mor}(A,B)$ as $g \circ f$, to suggest the **composition of mappings**. Similar result holds for $\operatorname{Mor}(B,A)$.

Given $f \in \operatorname{Mor}(A,B)$, $g \in \operatorname{Mor}(B,C)$, $h \in \operatorname{Mor}(C,D)$, we have
$$
(h \circ g)\circ f = h \circ(g \circ f)
$$
for all $A,B,C,D \in \operatorname{Ob}(\mathscr{C})$.

For $f \in \operatorname{Mor}(A,B)$, we oftentimes write $f : X \to Y$.
