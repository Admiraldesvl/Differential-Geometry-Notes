Fréchet derivative is a generalization to the ordinary derivative. This section is heavily based on the paper [*Introduction of Fréchet and Gâteaux Derivative*](http://www.m-hikari.com/ams/ams-password-2008/ams-password17-20-2008/behmardiAMS17-20-2008.pdf) though we are not discussing the latter one.

## Recall

A real-valued function $f(t)$ of a real variable, defined on some neighborhood of $0$, is said to be of $o(t)$ if
$$
\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(t)}{t}=0.
$$
And its derivative at some point $a$ is defined by
$$
f'(a)=\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.
$$
We also have this equivalent equation:
$$
f(a+h)=f(a)+f'(a)h+o(h).
$$
Now suppose $f:U \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ where $U$ is an open set. The function $f$ is differentiable at $x_0 \in U$ if satisfying the following conditions.

1. All partial derivatives of $f$, i.e. $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}$ exists for all $i=1,\cdots,m$ and $j = 1,\cdots,n$, exist at $f$. (Which ensures that the Jacobian matrix exists and is well-defined).

2. The Jacobian matrix $J(x_0)\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ satisfies
   $$
   \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{|f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)-J(x_0)h|}{|h|}=0
   $$
   In fact the Jacobian matrix has been the derivative of $f$ at $x_0$ although it's a matrix in lieu of number. But we should treat a number as a matrix in the general case.
