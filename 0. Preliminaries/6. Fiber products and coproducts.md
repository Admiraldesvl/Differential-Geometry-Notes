## Fiber product by an induced category

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category and $F \in \operatorname{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$. A new category $\mathcal{C}_F$ is defined as follows.

1. Objects. The objects of $\mathcal{C}_F$ are **morphisms** in $\mathcal{C}$ by

$$
f:X \to F
$$

2. Morphisms. By $h \in\operatorname{Mor}_{\mathcal{C}_F}(f,g)$, where $f:X \to P$ and $g:Y \to P$ are defined as 1, we mean $h \in \operatorname{Mor}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)$ and $h$ makes the following diagram commutative.

The **fiber product** of $f$ and $g$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is
