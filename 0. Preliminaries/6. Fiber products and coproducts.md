## Fiber product and coproduct as a dual

### Definition of fiber product

Let $X,Y,Z \in \operatorname{Ob}(C)$. A *fiber product* of $f:X \to Z$ and $g: Y \to Z$ is an **object** denoted by $X \times_Z Y$ together with two morphisms $p_1: X \times_Z Y \to X$ and $p_2: X \times_Z Y \to Y$ having the following properties

1. **(Fundamental property)** The sub-diagram consisting $X \times_Z Y -X - Y -Z$ is commutative.
2. **(Universal property)** Given any $T \in \operatorname{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ making the sub-diagram $T-X-Y-Z$ commutative, there exists a unique morphism $\gamma$ making the whole diagram commutative.

Respectively, $p_1$ are called the **pull-back** of $g$ by $f$, and $p_2$ the pull back of $f$ by $g$.

### Fiber coproduct

To define a fiber coproduct, one merely need to revert all arrows of the proceeding picture. Also, the two properties should be satisfied. Practically, the fiber coproduct is denoted by $X \amalg_Z Y$, and the morphism $q_1:X \to X \amalg_Z Y$ is called the push-out of $g$ by $f$.
