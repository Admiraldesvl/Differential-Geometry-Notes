## Normed Space

A **normed space** is a vector space $V$ endowed with a function
$$
V \to [0,\infty),\quad x \mapsto \lVert x \rVert
$$
which satisfies

1. $\lVert \lambda x \rVert = |\lambda| \lVert x \rVert$ for $\lambda \in \mathbb{K}$ and $x \in V$.
2. $\lVert x+y \rVert \leq \lVert x \rVert + \lVert y \rVert$.
3. $\lVert x \rVert=0$ if and only if $ x = 0$.

A vector space may allow for many different norms, but not all vector spaces are normable. In fact, a topological vector space $V$ is normable if and only if its origin has a convex bounded neighborhood. 

Using the *axiom of choice*, it is possible to assign a norm to any vector space, but this norm is not guaranteed to induce some natural structure. For example, let $\Omega$ be a nonempty open subset of the complex plane, then $H(\Omega)$, the space that consists all holomorphic functions, is not normable.

## Banach space

A **Banach space** is a normed space which is complete in the metric defined by its norm, that is, $d(x,y)=\lVert x - y \rVert$. It means that every Cauchy sequence has to converge.

An elementary example is $\mathbb{R}$. It is a vector space with norm $\lVert x \rVert = \sqrt{x^2}$, which is complete. But some spaces are not. For example, $H(\Omega)$ is not, since it's even not normable.
