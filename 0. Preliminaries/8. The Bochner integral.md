## Step mapping

We are considering an easy case of the Bochner integral, namely from $\mathbb{R}$ to a Banach space $\mathbf{E}$. Let $I$ denote a real, closed interval, namely $I=[a,b]$. A **step mapping** is a simple mapping
$$
\begin{aligned}
f:I &\to \mathbf{E} \\
x &\mapsto \sum_{j=1}^{n}\chi_{I_j}\alpha_j
\end{aligned}
$$
where $I_j$ denotes disjoint sub-interval (it can be open, closed, or neither). In this case, we denotes its integral by
$$
\int_a^b f(t)dt=\sum_{j=1}^{n}m(I_j)\alpha_j
$$
where $m$ is the Lebesgue measure.

## Uniform convergence and ruled mapping

Let $\mathbf{E}$ be a Banach space. Given a sequence of mappings $\{f_n:I \to \mathbf{E}\}$, we say it converges uniformly if, given a neighborhood $W$ of $0$ in $\mathbf{E}$, there exists some $n_0$ such that, for all $m,n>n_0$, we have
$$
\{y=f_n(t)-f_m(t):t \in I\}\subset W.
$$
The sequence $\{f_n\}$ converges to a mapping $f:I \to \mathbf{E}$.

A **ruled** mapping is a uniform limit of step mappings. This can of course be generalized in TVS, but we are not going that further.

> Every continuous function $f: I \to \mathbf{E}$ is ruled.

> Let $T \in L(\mathbf{E},\mathbb{R})$ be continuous, and $f: I \to \mathbf{E}$ be ruled, then $Tf=T \circ f$ is ruled.

## Bochner integral of ruled mappings

If $\{f_n\}$ is a sequence of step mapping converges uniformly to $f$, that is, $f$ is ruled, then we denotes the limit by
$$
\int_{a}^{b}f(t)dt=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_a^bf_n(t)dt
$$
