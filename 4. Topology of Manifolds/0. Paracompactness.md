## Definitions

Let $X$ be a topological space. A covering $\{U_i\}$ of $X$ is **locally finite** if every point has a neighborhood which intersects only finitely many elements of the covering $\{U_i\}$. A **refinement** is another covering $\{U'_i\}$. For each $U_j'$, there exists some $i$ such that $U_j' \subset U_i$.

A topological space $X$ is **paracompact** if it is Hausdorff, and every open covering has a locally finite refinement. Further, $X$ is a **normal** space if it satisfies Axiom $T_4$. That is, given any disjoint closed set $E$ and $F$, there are neighborhoods $U \supset E$ and $V \supset F$ such that $U$ and $V$ are also disjoint.

## Propositions

### Existence of 'regular' refinement

> If $X$ is a paracompact space, and if $\{U_i\}$ is an open covering, then there exists a locally finite open covering $\{V_i\}$ such that $V_i \subset U_i$ for each $i$. 

### Paracompactness implies normality

> If $X$ is paracompact, then $X$ is normal

### Existence of 'strictly regular' refinement

> If $\{U_i\}$ is a locally finite open covering of a paracompact space $X$, then there exists a locally finite open covering $\{V_i\}$ such that $\overline{V_i} \subset U_i$.
