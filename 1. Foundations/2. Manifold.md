## Definition

A $m$-dimensional manifold is a set $M$, together with a maximal atlas $\mathscr{A}=\{(U_\alpha,\varphi_\alpha\}$ satisfying the following properties:

> 1. **(Countability)** $M$ is covered by countably many coordinate charts in $\mathscr{A}$. There are indexes $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\cdots$ with $M=\cup_iU_{\alpha_i}$.
> 2. **(Hausdorff)** $(M,\mathscr{A})$ forms a Hausdorff space.
