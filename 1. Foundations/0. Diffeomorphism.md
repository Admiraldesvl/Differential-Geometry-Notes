## Definition

Let $U \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ and $V \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be open subsets. A map $f: U \to V$ is called *smooth* if it's infinitely differentiable. We may also write $f \in C^{\infty}(U,V)$. A map of $C^{\infty}(U,V)$ is called a diffeomorphism from $U$ to $V$ if it's invertible, and $f^{-1} \in C^{\infty}(V,U)$.
