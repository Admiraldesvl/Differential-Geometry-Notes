## Definition

Let $U \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ and $V \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be open subsets. A map $f: U \to V$ is called *smooth* if it's infinitely differentiable. We may also write $f \in C^{\infty}(U,V)$. A map of $C^{\infty}(U,V)$ is called a diffeomorphism from $U$ to $V$ if it's invertible, and $f^{-1} \in C^{\infty}(V,U)$. When such $f$ exists, $U$ and $V$ are called diffeomorphic (which is homeomorphic as well).

## Examples

#### Chain Rule

Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}^k$, $Y \subset \mathbb{R}^l$, $Z \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ be arbitrary subsets. If $f:X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to Z$ are smooth maps, then so is the composition $g \circ f : X \to Z$. The identity map $\operatorname{id}: X \to Z$ is trivially smooth.

#### Finite dimensional linear space

Let $E$ be a $m$-dimensional linear space, with basis $v_1,\cdots,v_m$, then the map $f:\mathbb{R}^m \to E$ by $(x_1,\cdots,x_m) \mapsto \sum_{i=1}^{m}x_iv_i$ is a diffeomorphism.

#### Triangle function

Let $X = (-\pi/2,\pi/2)$ and $Y=\mathbb{R}$. The function $f(x)=\tan{x}$ is a diffeomorphism since it's smooth, and the inverse by $f^{-1}(x)=\arctan{x}$ is also smooth.
