We will now discuss some basic examples of manifolds.

## Euclidean space

Standard Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ is of course a manifold. It requires a trivial chart, containing the identity map and $\mathbb{R}^n$ itself.

## Spheres

$$
S^n=\{(x_0,x_1,\cdots,x_n):x_0^2+x_1^2+\cdots+x_n^2=1\}
$$

Let $U_\pm$ be the subsets obtained by removing $(\mp1,0,\cdots,0)$. 

## Products

## Real projective spaces

## Grassmannians
