## Definition

A subset $S \subset M$ is called a *submanifold* of dimension $k$ if, for all $p \in S$, there exists a chart $(U,\varphi)$ such that $p \in (U,\varphi)$ and
$$
\varphi(U \cap S)=\varphi(U)\cap\mathbb{R}^k
$$

### Remarks

1. Charts $(U,\varphi)$ of $M$ with this property is called *submanifold charts* for $S$.
2. Here we have $k \leq m$, while $M$ is a manifold of dimension $m$.
